 <summary><h3>✋ About Me</h3></summary>
👨‍💻 I am a passionate Full Stack web developer with experience in creating, maintaining and updating different innovative and functional projects.
Currently, I have roles in two spaces alongside talented teams: as a developer at Gestioo and as a freelancer collaborating with Maza University.

💼 My focus in web development goes beyond writing code; I'm passionate about creating solutions that improve user experience and have a positive impact on the digital world. Over the past 2 years, I have worked on challenging projects that have allowed me to improve my technical skills and my ability to tackle complex problems.
At Gestioo, I am part of a highly collaborative team that is constantly looking for innovative ways to tackle different challenges. 
As a freelance programmer, I have the privilege of contributing to the educational environment at Maza University, where I can apply my skills to create effective and engaging educational solutions.
My technical skills include PHP, JavaScript, Vue.js, HTML, Bootstrap, among others. And I am looking forward to keep learning and adopting new technologies.

🌄 Outside of the digital world, my passion is physical activity and the mountains. I am a personal trainer and challenge my physical and mental limits by training, long distance running and climbing. Staying physically active is essential to me. I am also a mate enthusiast, an Argentine tradition that I enjoy sharing with friends and family.

🚀 My goal is to continue to grow as a developer and leader. I believe in the importance of building technology solutions that have a positive impact on people's lives. I value organization and effective communication in a team.

🎓 My studies include courses from the University of Alicante and the Complutense University of Madrid through Google Actívate, as well as the upcoming completion of the Tecnicatura Universitaria de Desarrollo de Software from the University of La Punta.


👋 I want to keep growing as a developer, using my experience and passion to deliver exceptional results in every project I participate in. I'm open to new opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to contact me if you think we can work together on a new project.
